# Automatic-Water-Level-Controller
This circuit control the overflow of water and also indicate the level of the water in the tank using microcontroller AT Mega8.
The main advantage of using a microcontroller is that the motor gets switched off when water reaches the determined level and starts only when the water level goes beyond the given level.
This project can also be done by using some IC's but in that the motor starts as the level goes below the highest level
